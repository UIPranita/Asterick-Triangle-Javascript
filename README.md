# Asterick-Triangle-Javascript
<p>Declare a variable numRows and assign it the value 8, which represents the number of rows in the triangle.</p>
<p>Use a for loop to iterate over each row of the triangle, starting from the first row <b>(a = 1)</b> and continuing up to and including the last row (a = triangle).</p>
<p>For each row, we declare a variable row and assign it an empty string.</p>
<p>We use another nested for loop to iterate over each column of the triangle, starting from the first column (b = 1) and continuing up to and including the last column for that row <b>(b = a)</b>.</p>
<p>For each column, we add a * character to the row variable using the <b>+= operator</b>.</p>
<p>After the inner loop completes, we output the row variable to the console using the console.log() method, which prints the row of * characters to the console.</p>
<p>This process repeats for each row of the triangle, creating a triangle of <b> * </b> characters with triangle rows.</p>
