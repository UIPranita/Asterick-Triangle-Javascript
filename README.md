# Asterick-Triangle-Javascript
<p>Declare a variable numRows and assign it the value 5, which represents the number of rows in the triangle.</p>
<p>Use a for loop to iterate over each row of the triangle, starting from the first row (i = 1) and continuing up to and including the last row (i = numRows).</p>
<p>For each row, we declare a variable row and assign it an empty string.</p>
<p>We use another nested for loop to iterate over each column of the triangle, starting from the first column (j = 1) and continuing up to and including the last column for that row (j = i).</p>
<p>For each column, we add a * character to the row variable using the += operator.</p>
<p>After the inner loop completes, we output the row variable to the console using the console.log() method, which prints the row of * characters to the console.</p>
<p>This process repeats for each row of the triangle, creating a triangle of * characters with numRows rows.</p>
